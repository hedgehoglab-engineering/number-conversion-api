# Number Conversion API

Welcome to our tech test!
This development task requires you to build a JSON API and so any HTML, CSS or JavaScript that is submitted will not be reviewed.


## Brief

Our client requires a simple RESTful API which will be used to perform numeric conversions from an integer to other numerical systems.

After our discussions with the client, we have discovered that the solution will:
- initially support conversions from integers to roman numerals
- contain endpoints allowing to perform the conversions
- contain endpoints allowing to fetch conversions performed most frequently or most recently

You will have to make some reasonable assumptions in place of talking to the client.

Take this opportunity to demonstrate your knowledge and don't be afraid of implementing something that might feel like overkill in the context of a small project.


## What we are looking for
- Use of MVC components (View in this instance can be, for example, an Eloquent API Resource)
- Use of Laravel features such as Eloquent ORM, Requests, Validation, Routes
- An implementation of the supplied interface
- The supplied PHPUnit test passing
- Clean, testable, object oriented code, following included code standards
- Use of modern PHP features where appropriate
- Following conventions you identify in the existing codebase
- Consideration given to the support of other numerical systems in the future


## Submission Instructions

Please create a [git bundle](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-bundle/) and send the file across:

```shell
git bundle create <yourname>.bundle --all --branches
```
