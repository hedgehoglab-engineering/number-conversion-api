# Number Conversion API

Welcome to our tech test!

This development task requires you to build a JSON API. Any HTML, CSS or JavaScript that is submitted will not be reviewed.


## Brief

Our client requires a simple RESTful API which will be used to perform numeric conversions from an integer to other numerical systems.

After our discussions with the client, we have discovered that the solution will:
- initially support conversions from integers to roman numerals
- contain endpoints allowing to perform the conversions
- contain endpoints allowing to fetch conversions based on the following criteria:
  - performed most frequently
  - performed most recently

In place of talking to the client you will have to make some reasonable assumptions about your implementation.

Take this opportunity to demonstrate your knowledge and don't be afraid of implementing patterns and approaches that might feel like overkill in the context of a small project.


## What we are looking for

- Use of MVC components (View in this instance can be, for example, an Eloquent API Resource)
- Use of Laravel features such as Eloquent ORM, Form Requests, Validation, Routes
- The supplied PHPUnit test passing
- Consideration given to the support of other numerical systems in the future
- Following the conventions you identify in the existing codebase
- Clean, testable, object oriented code, following the included code standards
- Use of modern PHP features where appropriate


## Submission Instructions

Please create a [git bundle](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-bundle/) and send the file across:

```shell
git bundle create <yourname>.bundle --all --branches
```
